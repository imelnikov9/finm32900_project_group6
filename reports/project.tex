\begin{abstract}
    Returns and cash flow growth for the aggregate U.S. stock market are highly and robustly predictable. 
    Using a single factor extracted from the cross-section of book-to-market ratios, 
    we find an out-of-sample return forecasting R\textsuperscript{2} of 13\% at the annual frequency (0.9\% monthly). 
    We document similar out-of-sample predictability for returns on value, size, momentum, and industry portfolios. 
    We present a model linking aggregate market expectations to disaggregated valuation ratios in a latent factor system. 
    Spreads in value portfolios’ exposures to economic shocks are key to identifying predictability and are consistent 
    with duration-based theories of the value premium.

\section{Replication Overview}

The replication of Table 1 from Kelly and Pruitt (2013) aimed to validate the 
findings on market return predictability using book-to-market ratios. In this project we 
tried reconstructuring the key univariate predictor by applying partial least squares (PLS) 
to book-to-market ratios, with the goal of closely mirroring the original study’s results.

\section{Successes}
Successfully accessed and processed CRSP and Compustat data to extract the relevant valuation 
ratios and market return data.
\\We have a great team.

\section{Challenges}

Data cleaning was time-intensive due to matching firm-level data from Compustat with 
returns from CRSP while ensuring proper alignment of fiscal periods.Academic Paper doesn't 
explicitely say how to shift the data for regressions. 
We've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to line up the data with to match the R Squared
LaTex set up and getting used to took a bit of time.

\section{Data Sources}

CRSP: Provided market returns, stock prices, and trading volume data.
\\Compustat: Supplied firm-level fundamentals, including book-to-market ratios, 
which are essential for constructing valuation-based predictors.
\\Fama-French Factors: Used as a robustness check to compare return predictability against standard factor-based models.\par
