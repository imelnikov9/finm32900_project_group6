\begin{abstract}
    Returns and cash flow growth for the aggregate U.S. stock market are highly and robustly predictable. 
    Using a single factor extracted from the cross-section of book-to-market ratios, 
    we find an out-of-sample return forecasting R\textsuperscript{2} of 13\% at the annual frequency (0.9\% monthly). 
    We document similar out-of-sample predictability for returns on value, size, momentum, and industry portfolios. 
    We present a model linking aggregate market expectations to disaggregated valuation ratios in a latent factor system. 
    Spreads in value portfoliosâ€™ exposures to economic shocks are key to identifying predictability and are consistent 
    with duration-based theories of the value premium.

\section{Challenges}

Academic Paper doesn't explicitely say how to shift the data for regressions. 
We've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to line up the data with to match the R Squared
LaTex set up and getting used to took a bit of time.
